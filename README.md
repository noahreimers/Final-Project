# Final-Project

In this project I’m analyzing NFL player rating data (from Pro Football Focus) and looking at which position groups are the most indicative of success. I will
include some analysis on when/how teams decided to build their team through the NFL Draft.

Elevator Pitch: 
NFL teams try to build up their team in two ways: through the draft, or through free agency. I’m going to evaluate the ability of NFL teams to rebuild their talent through the NFL Draft. I’ll do so by analyzing the player specific ratings for each player in the NFL from 2008 to 2012. I can also draw insight as to which position groups correlate the best with overall team performance. 

The main data used in this analysis was Pro Football Focus ratings between 2008 and 2012. The NFL Draft data was used from Football Reference.
